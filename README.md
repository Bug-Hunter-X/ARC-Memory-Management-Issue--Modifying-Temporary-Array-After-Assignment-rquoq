This repository demonstrates a subtle memory management issue in Objective-C when using ARC. The `bug.m` file contains code that exhibits the problem, while `bugSolution.m` provides a corrected version.  The issue involves modifying a temporary array after assigning it to a property, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution emphasizes directly manipulating the property instead of modifying a temporary variable after assignment.  This example highlights the importance of careful memory management, even with ARC.
